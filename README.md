# WSG
Bash command for wild strawberry genome (WSG)



# Genome data available
1) All the raw sequencing data have been submitted to the National Genomics Data Center (https://ngdc.cncb.ac.cn/), and the accession number is CRA005392.

2) All the genome assemblies reported in this paper have been deposited in the GWH (https://ngdc.cncb.ac.cn/gwh), and the accession number is GWHDEDQ00000000 (F. chiloensis), GWHDEDR00000000 (F. virginiana) and GWHDEDN00000000 (F. nipponica).

3) The genome assembly and annotation files are also uploaded on the Genome Database for Rosaceae (GDR) (Staff expects to be able to make it available this week).
